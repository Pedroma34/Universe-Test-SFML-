# Universe (Test project)
Infinite universe inspired by our daddy programmer OneLoneCoder (javidx9.) It uses SFML, spdlog, and Imgui. Still in development and it's just for fun.
# How to BUILD (Premake)
Simply open "GenerateFiles.bat" and it will build a Visual Studio 2022 Solution for you. Then, compile (better in release mode, duh.) It should not give any errors. If you want to build for a diferent compiler or Visual Studio Version, edit the .bat file.
# CONTROLS
W,S,A,D to move camera. Mouse wheel to zoom in and out. F1 for show debug menu. F11 for full screen or windowed.
